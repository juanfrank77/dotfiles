# dotfiles

The motivation for creating this was having to reinstall my whole dev environment once I transitioned to WSL2.

It gave me an opportunity to review my setup and find about all the things that I was missing from previously.

I took a whole weekend to do the research and customization of my newly installed Ubuntu 20.04 distro and just
so I don't lose any of my configs again and have to re do them in the future I'm saving them here.

Also, there are some things that changed with WSL2 that created incompatibilities with my previous setup, so I
intend to keep this repo updated as much as possible so I can pretty much reconfigure in just a moment any new WSL
distro or even an actual Linux installation in another pc if needs be.
